# Enchantment Rebalance
This mod alters and rebalances Minecraft's protection and damage enchantments to make your enchantment choices matter. In addition, it also adds a collection of new enchantments for all types of items.

## Protection Enchantments
All protection enchantments now go up to level V, with each level providing 8% damage reduction for appropriate damage types. This means two fully-enchanted pieces of armor are enough to hit the 80% damage reduction cap. Shields can be enchanted with these protection enchantments as well, and provide damage reduction when held in the off-hand.
* **Elemental Protection:** Replaces Fire Protection and additionally reduces damage from environmental hazards like frost, lightning, and cacti.
* **Magic Protection:** Replaces Blast Protection and additionally reduces damage from magical sources like guardian beams, a Warden's sonic boom, and the Wither effect.
* **Melee Protection:** Replaces Protection and only reduces damage from melee attacks or collisions, but reduces damage by 8% per level instead of 4%.
* **Projectile Protection:** Additionally reduces damage from falling anvils, stalactites, or other blocks.
* **Feather Falling:** Reduces falling damage by 16% per level instead of 12%, meaning a single pair of boots can provide 80% damage reduction from falling. Mutually exclusive with other protection enchantments.

## Damage Enchantments
Smite and Sharpness are unchanged, but Bane of Arthropods is upgraded and joined by two new competing enchantments. You can configure exactly which mobs these new enchantments damage, for compatibility with mods that add new mobs.
* **Invertebane:** Replaces Bane of Arthropods, now dealing its extra damage and slowness to creeping, slimy, and shelled mobs. By default, this includes guardians, slimes, shulkers, and creepers as well as the normal set of arthropods.
* **Sentinel:** Deals extra damage to humanoid monsters like illagers, witches, piglins, and endermen.
* **Hunter:** Deals extra damage to wild animals like cows, polar bears, and hoglins.
* **Impaling:** Now deals its extra damage to all mobs in water or rain, as well as all aquatic mobs in all circumstances.

## Tool Enchantments
All harvesting tools (axes, pickaxes, shovels, hoes, and shears) can receive these enchantments, which are mutually exclusive.
* **Collector:** When breaking a block with this tool, drops will be collected directly into your inventory rather than falling into the world.
* **Outstretch:** Your reach with this tool is increased by 1 block for each level of the enchantment (up to 2).

## Unique Enchantments
These enchantments each apply to one particular type of item.
* **Precise Point:** Applies to swords and is exclusive with Sweeping Edge. Attack speed with this sword is increased by 0.1 per level (up to 3), but the sword no longer does sweeping attacks.
* **Guillotine (Treasure):** Applies to axes. Mobs killed with this axe have a 2.5% chance per level (up to 3) to drop their heads.
* **Earth Eater (Treasure):** Applies to pickaxes. Stone, deepslate, netherrack, and end stone is destroyed with no drops, but costs no durability to break.
* **Mattock (Treasure):** Applies to shovels. The tool can also break lower-tier stone and wood blocks as if it was a wooden axe and pickaxe.
* **Verdant (Treasure):** Applies to hoes. Right-click on a crop or sapling to fertilize it as if you used bonemeal, for a durability cost.
* **Nocturnal (Treasure):** Applies to helmets and is exclusive with Aqua Affinity and Respiration. While wearing this helmet, you gain night vision and phantoms are neutral to you.
* **Endurance:** Applies to chestplates and is exclusive with Vitality. Food depletion from moving and fighting is reduced to 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4 of normal depending on enchantment level.
* **Vitality:** Applies to chestplates and is exclusive with Endurance. Each level (up to 3) decreases the minimum food necessary to naturally regenerate and increases the speed of natural regeneration.
* **High Climb:** Applies to leggings and is exclusive with Swift Stride. The wearer can step up 1-block heights.
* **Swift Stride:** Applies to leggings and is exclusive with High Climb. The wearer's speed is increased by 5% for each level (up to 4).
