# Enchantment Rebalance
This mod alters and rebalances Minecraft's protection and damage enchantments to make your enchantment choices matter.

## Protection Enchantments
All protection enchantments now go up to level V, with each level providing 8% damage reduction for appropriate damage types. This means two fully-enchanted pieces of armor are enough to hit the 80% damage reduction cap. Shields can be enchanted with these protection enchantments as well, and provide damage reduction when held in the off-hand.
* **Elemental Protection:** Replaces Fire Protection and additionally reduces damage from environmental hazards like frost, lightning, and cacti.
* **Magic Protection:** Replaces Blast Protection and additionally reduces damage from magical sources like guardian beams, a Warden's sonic boom, and the Wither effect.
* **Melee Protection:** Replaces Protection and only reduces damage from melee attacks or collisions, but reduces damage by 8% per level instead of 4%.
* **Projectile Protection:** Additionally reduces damage from falling anvils, stalactites, or other blocks.
* **Feather Falling:** Reduces falling damage by 16% per level instead of 12%, meaning a single pair of boots can provide 80% damage reduction from falling. Mutually exclusive with other protection enchantments.

## Damage Enchantments
Smite and Sharpness are unchanged, but Bane of Arthropods is upgraded and joined by two new competing enchantments. You can configure exactly which mobs these new enchantments damage, for compatibility with mods that add new mobs.
* **Invertebane:** Replaces Bane of Arthropods, now dealing its extra damage and slowness to creeping, slimy, and shelled mobs. By default, this includes guardians, slimes, shulkers, and creepers as well as the normal set of arthropods.
* **Sentinel:** Deals extra damage to humanoid monsters like illagers, witches, piglins, and endermen.
* **Hunter:** Deals extra damage to wild animals like cows, polar bears, and hoglins.
* **Impaling:** Now deals its extra damage to all mobs in water or rain, as well as all aquatic mobs in all circumstances.
